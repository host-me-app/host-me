# Host me app!

Idea :
This is an application that allows foreign students to simplify the search for accommodation near
the universities in Lausanne. The user can manage and import his documents (residence permit...)
fill in his data (university, Swiss guarantor, price range...) and search for rooms, studios,
flatshares, apartments near their university (EPFL, UNIL, EHL, CHUV...) and contact the owners
directly via the chat feature of the application or video for visiting. Users can see photos, the
price, the rental period and the description of the accommodation with the facilities available and
the requirements to rent it. They will also be able to add homes to their favorites. Therefore,
students will have to create an account and authenticate themselves to access the application (why
not use the login platforms of the different universities to verify the status of the users).
Students will be able to use an interactive map to locate the apartment in relation to their
university and find out how long it will take to get there. Another optional feature is the visit of
the apartment in 3D or virtual reality (we still have to define the complexity of development and
use of such a feature).
